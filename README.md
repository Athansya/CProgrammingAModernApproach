# C Programming: A Modern Approach
I've always wanted to learn C in detail, plus I have an interest in embedded systems. So, in my quest for knowledge, I stumbled with this beautiful book written by K. N. King. C is an old language developed in the early 1970s at Bell Laboratories by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. C has grown a long way and is still quite popular for a number of applications:

- Language Compiler Design
- Operating System Design
- Embedded Systems
- GUI Design
- Drivers
- Programming Languages Desing
- Etc.

## Advantages
- Efficiency
- Portability
- Power
- Flexibility
- Standard library
- Integration with UNIX

## Disadvantages
- Error-prone
- Complexity
- Difficult to modify other's programs

## Final note
With this repository, I hope to share with you my journey into C. Hopefully, you'll learn something too. Feel free to ask questions or give feedback.
